# Simple-PHP-Invoicing
Simple PHP Invoicing Application in PHP and mySQL
Using PHP, mySQL and Simple PHP Invoicing, you can create professional looking invoices. 
The application uses the FPDF library to produce PDF formatted invoices which can be printed or emailed to your customers.

It meets the requirements from IRD for invoices for New Zealand Companies. 

This is a standalone application which has its advantages but one disadvantage is that you do have access to your customer list. 
You need to load a minimum of information for each customer you wish to invoice.
